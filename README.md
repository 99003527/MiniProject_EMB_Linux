# MiniProject_EMB_Linux
      The project is all about a car gear system, here in this project we used beagle bone black as a primary control unit and joystick as a gear and to describe the action LED was used.
      When the joystick was moved forward, the intensity of the LED will be increased. Which is to be considered as a Front Gear.
      When the joystick was moved backward, the intensity of the LED will be decreased. Which is to be considered as a Back Gear.
      When the joystick was in neutral position, there will be no change in the LED intensity.
